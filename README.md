# DataStructure-ParkingSlot

The program aims creating the best possible car parking arrangement at an Airport. The parking place is shown as a graph, with each node representing a parking space, complete with a capacity and access fee. The cars enter the facility in the sequence that they would naturally, choosing the space that will cost them the least. The objective is to determine each vehicle's least overall cost, considering the cost of the route travelled to get to the parking space as well as the parking charge. To solve this problem, I have implemented a Java program that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the minimum cost path in a graph. The program takes input for the number of slots, edges, base parking fee, slot capacities, slot connections, and the number of vehicles. It then calculates and outputs the minimum total cost for each vehicle. The code design involves creating classes to represent the slots and edges, as well as lists to store the slot and edge information. The Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to find the minimum cost path for each vehicle, considering slot capacities and costs. T
